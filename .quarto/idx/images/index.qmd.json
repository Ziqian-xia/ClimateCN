The results reveal that people tend to conflate climate change with air pollution and seasonal weather changes. Although skepticism is not prominent, voices for action are also limited. Furthermore, climate change perceptions are heterogeneous across regions and demographic groups. Respondents from developed cities are less likely to conflate climate change with local weather. People living in polluted regions tend to equate climate change with air pollution. Well-educated, high-income, and young residents are more aware of the scientific dimensions of climate change and its consequences. Females and the elderly think more about health implications and how to adapt. Compared to Western countries, opinions about climate change in China are less polarized and controversial, probably due to different political realities and media framings. \n\n![Mental Images of Climate Change Awareness in China](survey.jpg)\n\n\n\nRespondents’ mental images are also revolving around a limited number of subtopics. Rainy or cold weather, air pollution and high temperature, as the top three subcategories, are all related to local micro-climatic and environmental changes and are not directly related to climate change. Those three sub-images account for about one third (33.8%) of all the answers when combined. Unbalanced proportions of mental images show that respondents fail to grasp the full spectrum of climate change externalities.\n\n![Proportion of mental images received per city.

The popularity of weather is significantly associated with the city’s development level as indicated by the per capita annual income. In the three least developed cities (Guyuan, Yancheng, and Yangzhou), the weather mental image is picked by 25% of respondents. People in developed cities (Hangzhou and Suzhou) are less likely to confuse climate change with micro-climate patterns probably due to higher rates of educated people.\n\nOur results show that confusion between climate change and pollution is widespread nationally. The pollution mental image ranks in the top five most popular mental images among all the surveyed cities and is positively correlated with the actual PM2.5 concentration level of each city. In general, pollution shares slightly larger proportions among eastern coastal cities where environmental issues are more evident (e.g., Suzhou, 21% and Yangzhou, 20%). By comparing the relative prevalence of the sub-image air pollution, we find more pronounced disparities across cities. For developed coastal cities such as Suzhou, 91% of answers are about poor air quality or specific air pollutants such as PM2.5 and ozone. In cities far from the eastern coast with better air quality such as Dongguan, only 50% of answers are about air pollution.\n\n## National survey of mental images unpacks over estimated climate change awareness in China\n\nFigure below presents four mental images (\n*The color in each map is proportional to the projected percentage of the population who have the mental image of A) global warming, B) environmental degradation, C) solution, and D) weather, respectively.
