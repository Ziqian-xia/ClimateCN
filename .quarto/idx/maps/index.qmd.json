Drawing from two national surveys conducted in 2010 and 2023, we were able to capture the perception of a combined total of 15,833 respondents. Our primary tools for measurement were two pivotal questions that gauged climate change issue priority and risk perception:\n\n- “Is climate change the most urgent environmental problem in China?” (Termed as **'Perceived Priority'**)\n- “Will climate change have the greatest impact on you and your families compared to other environmental issues?” (Termed as **'Perceived Impact'**).\n\n### Perceived Priority of Climate Change\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(leaflet)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\nload(\"ppfull.RData\")\nppfull\n\n```\n\n<br>\n\nAcross the board, there's a noticeable uptick in the perceived priority of climate change in China. The national average surged from a modest **5.91%** in 2010 to a more substantial **23.4%** in 2023. This growth wasn't uniform, with 2010 figures ranging from 4.4% in *Beijing* to 11.5% in *Yunnan*.

The national average climbed from **4.04%** in **2010** to **15.6%** in **2023**. In 2010, the range of people who believed climate change would have the most significant impacts was between 2.4% in *Beijing* to 8.4% in *Yunnan*. By 2023, these figures had grown, ranging from 12.9% in *Shandong* to 22.9% in *Heilongjiang*. This growth can be attributed to factors such as increased media coverage, personal experiences with climate change effects, and intensified policy efforts both domestically and internationally.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Misalignment Between Potential Risk and Perceived Impact\nOur study highlighted that the growth in climate change perceptions wasn't uniform across provinces. The variations in perceptions across provinces intensified from 2010 to 2023, suggesting that the evolution of climate change perceptions has been distinct across China's diverse regions. This disparity may exacerbate the unequal distribution of climate change impacts, as individuals in regions with higher perceived risk might be more inclined to adopt adaptation and mitigation strategies, while those in areas with lower perceived risk may be less likely to take action\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n### Map of risk-perception ratio in China\n\n(A) The provincial map visualizes the relationship between perceived impact of climate change and exposure to extreme weather events, illustrating the spatial distribution of climate risk across China.
