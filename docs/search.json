    "text": "Mental Images of Climate Change Awareness in China\nPrevious studies suggest optimistically high climate change awareness in China, theworld’s largest carbon emitter Yet it is unknown how the discourse is interpreted byindividual’s own frame, due to largely adopted Yes-No survey design. This study, for thefirst time, performed a nationwide open-ended survey covering 4,037 respondents,identifies seven distinct mental images that exclusively represent Chinese residents’conceptualization of climate change, including global warming, distant icons, naturaldisasters, environmental degradation, cause, solution, and weather."

Furthermore, climate change perceptions are heterogeneous across regions and demographic groups. Respondents from developed cities are less likely to conflate climate change with local weather. People living in polluted regions tend to equate climate change with air pollution. Well-educated, high-income, and young residents are more aware of the scientific dimensions of climate change and its consequences.

In general, pollution shares slightly larger proportions among eastern coastal cities where environmental issues are more evident (e.g., Suzhou, 21% and Yangzhou, 20%). By comparing the relative prevalence of the sub-image air pollution, we find more pronounced disparities across cities.

National mean prevalence weighted by city-level population groups each is labeled on the color bar.)\nOur results show that climate change perceptions in China exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity. For example, we project that on a national average, 34.1% of Chinese people will explain climate change as global warming. Still, this value could range from a high of 56% in developed cities like Beijing to a low of 20% in cities in Tibet and North Eastern regions. For the mental image of environmental degradation, we find that clusters of hotspots are widely spread in the Northern and Eastern Plain regions of China urban agglomerations centered around Beijing and Shanghai). These places are also the hubs of manufacturing sectors in China, such as steel and iron productions, and endure the severest environmental problems (such as air pollution, waste, and water scarcity).\nThe mental image of the solution has the lowest popularity in China, with an estimated national mean of only 11.0%. Coastal regions and capital cities in each province are projected to have a relatively higher awareness of climate change solutions, probably because of better higher educational resources.\n\n\n\nEstimates of prevalence for four climate change mental images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated publications\n\n\n\n\n\nYang, J., Gounaridis, D., Liu, M., Bi, J., & Newell, J.
